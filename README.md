# First Java Task
Building a basic calculator using Java console I/O

->  The Calculater.java is in src/main/java/org.example/
Sure! I created a Java program called Calculator.java that acts as a simple console-based calculator. Here's a straightforward explanation of what it does and how it works:

What the Program Does
It lets users perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users interact with it through the console (like a terminal or command prompt).
It keeps running, allowing multiple calculations, until the user chooses to exit.
How It Works
Menu Display:
The program shows a menu with five options:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Exit
Users type a number (1â€“5) to pick an operation.
User Input:
It uses a Scanner to read input from the console.
After picking an operation, the user enters two numbers to calculate (e.g., 5 and 3 for 5 + 3).
Calculations:
The program has four methods:
add(a, b): Returns a + b
subtract(a, b): Returns a - b
multiply(a, b): Returns a * b
divide(a, b): Returns a / b (checks for division by zero)
Based on the user's choice, it calls the right method and shows the result (e.g., "5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00").
Loop for Multiple Calculations:
The program runs in a while loop, so after each calculation, it shows the menu again.
It stops only when the user selects Exit (option 5).
Error Handling:
If the user enters something invalid (like letters instead of numbers), it shows an error message and asks again.
For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid errors.
Key Features
Simple and Clear: The menu and prompts make it easy to use.
Safe: It handles bad inputs gracefully.
Reusable: The loop lets users do as many calculations as they want.
Formatted Output: Results are shown with two decimal places for clarity (e.g., 8.00).
How to Run It
Save the code in a file named Calculator.java.
Use a Java IDE (like VS Code or IntelliJ) or terminal:
Compile: javac Calculator.java
Run: java Calculator
